# text_classification_project
The project is aimed at implementing multiple machine learning methods on texts to classify and cluster news topics.

### Motivation
In read world practice, we always have a need to categorize received information. That is for the convenience of storing and retrieving. Text classification is widely researched topic. In our project, we attempt to dive deeper into the most popular machine learning methods used for text classification. For this midterm project, we chose multinomial Na√Øve Bayesian, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest for implementation, and compare their performance in text classification.

### Data Preparation
The dataset used in this project is news articles published by English Newspaper Guardian during 2012 to present. The Guardian created its own Open Source platform to all the contents the newspaper created, categorized by tags and section. Developers only need to register for an API key to get access to the whole dataset.
